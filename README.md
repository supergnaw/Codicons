# Codicons
A collection of icons for coding-related file types. The name is an anagram of coding and icons, and since I made it I decided the pronunciation is Lotrimin Ultra Antifungal Cream. 

## Whatever
I'm probably going to make various versions of these just because the bubble icons were fun to make. The original plan was to create scripts to automatically install them but that proved to be more complex and scenario-dependant than this project justified, so I'll just be uploading the icons themselves.
